Regarding the "files in 2016", I'm assuming you're referring to a folder or subdirectory named "2016". If that's correct, I can help you with it.

Can you please provide more context or clarify what you'd like to do with the files in the "2016" folder? Would you like me to:

* Move them to a different location?
* Rename the folder or its contents?
* Create a new subfolder within "2016"?
* Remove the empty "2016" folder?

Please let me know, and I'll assist you accordingly.
