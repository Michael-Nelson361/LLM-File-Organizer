2025-08-14 16:52:00,422 - file_organizer - INFO - LLM response: To provide a clear overview of the current filesystem structure, I'll list the contents of the root directory. This will give us a starting point to understand how we can organize and restructure your files and folders.

I'll use the `list_directory` function to display the contents of the root directory. Please confirm if this is what you'd like me to do.

(Note: I won't perform any actions yet, but rather provide an overview of the current state.)
